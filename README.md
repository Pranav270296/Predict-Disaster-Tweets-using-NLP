# Predict-Disaster-Tweets-using-NLP
Twitter has become an important communication social media channel in times of emergency. It is very useful because it now enables people to announce an emergency they are observing in real time. Because of this reason, more companies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter specially for disaster prediction. However, it is not always clear whether a personâ€™s words are announcing a disaster.
Therefore, this project essentially outlines and helps us predict whether a particular tweet is actually a disaster tweet or not.
